# Early Universe Entropy Simulation

This simulation visualizes the increase in entropy from a low-entropy, high-order state (Big Bang) to higher entropy states as particles diffuse over time.

## Features

- 2D grid simulation of particle diffusion.
- Entropy computed using Shannon entropy.
- Visual display of entropy evolution.

## Controls

- `R` - Reset the simulation.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Concept

- Initially, all particles are concentrated in one grid cell.
- Over time, they diffuse randomly.
- Entropy increases as the system becomes more disordered.
